# 1D Core-Collapse Supernovae Code

This is a 1D lagrangian code to explore CCSN modeling. For progenitors, it takes KEPLER generated [data](https://2sn.org/stellarevolution/) of Alex Heger & Stan Woosley.

Turbulence is treated through mixing length theory (MLT), BHR, and Machine Learning (ML) based models.
