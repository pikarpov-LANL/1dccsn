COLLAPSO1D supports `gfortran` and Intel's Classic Fortran `ifort`. The latter runs ~70% faster, but requires a more involved installation.

## Modeling 1D Turbulence in Core-Collapse Supernovae with Machine Learning

The simulations have been produced with [PIMLTurb1D](https://sapsan-wiki.github.io/details/estimators/#physics-informed-cnn-for-1d-turbulence-modeling-pimlturb1d) ML model. Below are the links to view and download evolution profiles for all tracked variables, e.g., velocity, entropy, pressure, etc. Both high-resolution 9000 grid points runs and the low resolution 2000 grid points runs are provided.
