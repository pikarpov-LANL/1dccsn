# Welcome

COLLAPSO1D is a 1D lagrangian code for Core-Collapse Supernova (CCSN) modeling. For progenitors, it takes [KEPLER](https://2sn.org/kepler/doc/Introduction.html) generated data. Currently, there is support for [Heger & Woosley, 2000](https://2sn.org/stellarevolution/) and [Sukhbold et al, 2016](http://doi.org/10.17617/1.b).

Turbulence is treated through Machine Learning (ML) based models. The latter has been trained using the [Sapsan](https://github.com/pikarpov-LANL/Sapsan) ML pipeline.

PyTorch is implemented based on [pytorch-fortran](https://github.com/alexeedm/pytorch-fortran).
